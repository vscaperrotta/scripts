## Script list

### Auto Zip Archive
This script in python allows you to zip pairs of .jpg and .eps files in the same folder.

### Calculate next ID
This script allows you to calculate the next id after the one you arrived at. It was created as an exercise for an infinite scroll carousel, where it was necessary to derive the ids of each card at any given time.
