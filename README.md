# My Scripts
In this repository I upload some scripts that have served me over the years. Some were written early in my journey as a programmer, so I apologize in advance for the quality of the code. 🙏

## Script list

### Auto Zip Archive
💻 **Language**: Python

This script in python allows you to zip pairs of .jpg and .eps files in the same folder.

### Calculate next ID
💻 **Language**: JavaScript

This script allows you to calculate the next id after the one you arrived at. It was created as an exercise for an infinite scroll carousel, where it was necessary to derive the ids of each card at any given time.
